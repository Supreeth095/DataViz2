# Assignment 2 - Creating Charts

### Learning Goal
Train yourself in creating a visualization appropriate for a specific dataset.

### Dataset - Atlanta Crime dataset

This data details the crimes committed in the city/greater metropolitan area of Atlanta from the year 2009 to 2018.

The attributes of this dataset are:Â 

- Report Number
- Beat (In police terminology, a beat is the territory and time that a police officer patrols.)
- Report Date
- Occur Date and Time
- Apartment Number
- Location (Address)
- Shift Occurrence ( a value that can be [Morning, Day, Evening])
- UCR (Uniform Crime Reports) a code that represents the type of crime.
- Neighborhood
- NPU (Neighborhood planning unit) 25 values



### Instructions

#### Step 1

Make sure you have a clear understanding of what each attribute means and what values it contains (ask questions to the instructor if you have doubts).

#### Step 2

Create data visualization sketches to investigate the following questions. For each sketch describe in words what are the marks and channels that are used.

1. What are the most dangerous neighborhoods?
2. What are the most dangerous times of a day?
3. Are crimes increasing or decreasing since 2008?


#### Step 3

Now suppose to have the following additional data.

- Immigration status (this indicates the immigration status of the person reporting the crime can be either "Citizen" or "Immigrant")
- Amount (this indicates the amount of stolen/damaged goods)


Create data visualization sketches to investigate the following questions. For each sketch describe in words what are the marks and channels that are used.

4. Are immigrants more likely to get involved as a victim of a crime?
5. What is the cost for the society (people of Atlanta) for the crimes that happened in 2018?

#### Bonus

Define your own question and design a visualization for answering it.


### Submission

Modify this README file by adding sketches of the visualization designed. Pair each image with a description of the marks and channels used.
